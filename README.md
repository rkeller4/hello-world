BRANCH THIRTEEN
Just noticed for the first time that when I open this "Repo-Repository-master branch", it appears I can just start editing it directly. The guide doesn't directly mention that. I wonder if I have edited the Repo directly in any of these 13 sessions and I didn't realize it. Maybe that could account for some differences between the UI and the guide. Forging on.

BRANCH TWELVE HERE. (From now on I intend to call "Hello World" the "guide" and the GitHub UI the "UI".) It concerns me that I'm just now noticing some differences between the guide and the UI after eleven editing sessions. I wasn't even aware of the differences until now because I think I was too caught up in the struggle with the overall complexity of the UI and guide. 

That seems like a recipe for trouble, especially since what I am doing now - a sole user opening a single Repo/Repository/master branch repeatedly - is likely to be so simple compared to sharing and collaborating with other people on any number of simultaneous branches. (That is just my guess as to where this is headed.)

I would like to try decorating this text a little - fonts, headings, tables, bulleted lists. (Right now I'm making notes on paper.) I see nothing on this current page that suggests how to do any of that typical word processing. I've opened "Settings" before, but I hesitate to do so now. I right-click on settings and I get no information. What happened to the convention that a right click explains the consequences of a left click? So now I go ahead and left click on "Settings" and I get the message "Leave site? Changes may not be saved." This is suboptimal design.

Oh, I just discovered that I can highlight a word, right click, and get the option of a spell check. Does it do a spell check? No.

Can I just write in some other editor and then copy/paste content into here? Bet I can't.

I just left clicked the "Actions" menu item and got the same "Leave site?" message. I clicked on "Insights" and same thing ("Leave site?") Pathetic design.

COMMIT CHANGES

In visit eleven, below, I noted that when I wished to end the editing cycle, the guide said to click the UI "commit changes" button, but the UI contained no such button. (I looked for it very carefully.) Now, on this 12th pass, I scroll down and now there is a "commit changes" button. I have no idea why. Bye for now.

ELEVEN

This is the visit via branch eleven. The content from branch ten has been correctly incorporated below. I'm now making a larger chart and noting differences between the "hello world" guide and the actual GitHub interface and I'll be looking for any errors I might introduce in my flow chart via subsequent editing passes. (In text editing, where I am right now, the idiosyncratic "end" button behavior remains confusing.)

TEN

This is visit ten. I've attempted to write out a flow chart of the 10 GitHub steps (ignoring for now the plethora of little intermediate steps) required to execute what typically would be three steps: 
(1) open document  
(2) edit document  
(3) save document

I'll follow my flow chart and see if this text gets into the "Repo" "Repository" "master branch".

NINE

Now I'm back for visit nine.

EIGHT

Now I'm back for visit eight.

SEVEN

Uh oh. I think this is visit seven, and for some reason I don't see visit six. I'm puzzled. Onward.

Visit five. The excitement is palpable! This also has me thinking about two other pieces of collaboration software: Google Drive and Wikipedia. Can you imagine the sleek design of the organization behind Wikipedia manages the content of the "Donald Trump" page while still freely allowing anyone to edit any Wikipedia page at any time? And as a contributer to Wikipedia, you just start writing. No user name, no account, no password.

OK, here I am for visit four. Please disregard the above. That is from the future.

Here I am, back for my third visit. I am delighted to be here! What a PLACE. Now to see if I can successfully get out of my third visit and go back to my COMPLETELY BORING life.

When I created this GitHub account, I found GitHub rejected a perfectly strong password as "being too weak". The authors of GitHub ought to update their password creation code.

The initial login page offers a "Hello World" guide. When I opened that "Hello World" guide, I read a note that said "this guide will be created in a new tab so you can still refer to your initial page!" This note should be on the initial page as part of the introduction of the "Hello World" guide, not in the "Hello World" guide itself.

The "Read the guide" introduction on the intial page says that, using the guide, you will "start a branch, write comments, and open a pull request". But actually the "Hello World" guide begins by asking you to create a repository.

But I already created a repository on the first page because the description of the "Hello World guide" did not mention that it was going to ask me to create a repository and I could see clearly that the first step on the first page was creating a repository. So now I have two repositories. What does that mean? An unneccessary complication at this point.

There alsoo apppearrs to bv noo spell--cheecker in this editerator. I try opening "Settings" on the menu above and that merely warns me that I am leaving this page and my changes "might not be saved".

Under "creating a branch", the "Hello World" guide says "By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch." Yet it gives no instruction for entering any information into this definitive branch. 

Reading further, the guide seems to imply that you cannot directly enter information into the "definitive branch" - you must instead create a branch off the definitive branch (for some reason, this second branch is called "feature") and "feature" will then sometime in the future be merged into the definitive branch. The guide also suggests that if other people work on your definitive branch while you are working in the "feature" branch, you can "pull in those updates". How do you know that someone else is working on your definitive branch? No hint.

Also, in an editor, pressing the "end" key should take the cursor to the end of the current line, not the end of the current paragraph.
