# hello-world

This is visit ten. I've attempted to write out a flow chart of the 10 GitHub steps (ignoring for now the plethora of little intermediate steps) required to execute what used to be three steps: 
(1) open the document  
(2) edit the document  
(3) save the document

I'll follow my flow chart and see if this text gets into the "Repo" "Repository" "master branch".

Now I'm back for visit nine.

Now I'm back for visit eight.

Uh oh. I think this is visit seven, and for some reason I don't see visit six. I'm puzzled. Onward.

Visit five. The excitement is palpable! This also has me thinking about two other pieces of collaboration software: Google Drive and Wikipedia. Can you imagine the sleek design of the organization behind Wikipedia manages the content of the "Donald Trump" page while still freely allowing anyone to edit any Wikipedia page at any time? And as a contributer to Wikipedia, you just start writing. No user name, no account, no password.

OK, here I am for visit four. Please disregard the above. That is from the future.

Here I am, back for my third visit. I am delighted to be here! What a PLACE. Now to see if I can successfully get out of my third visit and go back to my COMPLETELY BORING life.

When I created this GitHub account, I found GitHub rejected a perfectly strong password as "being too weak". The authors of GitHub ought to update their password creation code.

The initial login page offers a "Hello World" guide. When I opened that "Hello World" guide, I read a note that said "this guide will be created in a new tab so you can still refer to your initial page!" This note should be on the initial page as part of the introduction of the "Hello World" guide, not in the "Hello World" guide itself.

The "Read the guide" introduction on the intial page says that, using the guide, you will "start a branch, write comments, and open a pull request". But actually the "Hello World" guide begins by asking you to create a repository.

But I already created a repository on the first page because the description of the "Hello World guide" did not mention that it was going to ask me to create a repository and I could see clearly that the first step on the first page was creating a repository. So now I have two repositories. What does that mean? An unneccessary complication at this point.

There alsoo apppearrs to bv noo spell--cheecker in this editerator. I try opening "Settings" on the menu above and that merely warns me that I am leaving this page and my changes "might not be saved".

Under "creating a branch", the "Hello World" guide says "By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch." Yet it gives no instruction for entering any information into this definitive branch. 

Reading further, the guide seems to imply that you cannot directly enter information into the "definitive branch" - you must instead create a branch off the definitive branch (for some reason, this second branch is called "feature") and "feature" will then sometime in the future be merged into the definitive branch. The guide also suggests that if other people work on your definitive branch while you are working in the "feature" branch, you can "pull in those updates". How do you know that someone else is working on your definitive branch? No hint.

Also, in an editor, pressing the "end" key should take the cursor to the end of the current line, not the end of the current paragraph.
