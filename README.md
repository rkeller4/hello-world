# hello-world
my initial use of GitHub, which I'm guessing will involve considering some changes to the first couple of pages of github

When I opened this GitHub account, I found GitHub rejected a perfectly strong password as "being too weak". This suggests that the authors of GitHub either don't understand the current state of encryption, or else they haven't bothered to update their outdated code that handles password creation. Neither option casts GitHub in a very good light.

As I recall, the initial login page offered the option of a link to a "Hello World" guide. When I opened that "Hello World" guide, a note said "this guide will be created in a new tab so you can still refer to your initial page." This note is useless when placed within "Hello World" because it can only be seen after you have opened the "Hello World" guide. This note about preserving the initial page needs to be on the initial page as part of the note about the "Hello World" guide.

And, when using the "Hello World" guide, I find that the actions that the "Hello World" guide asks that I take immediately makes that intial page disappear, in spite of the fact that the "Hello World" guide suggested it was opening in a new tab so I could continue to see that initial page.

The "Read the guide" link for the "Hello World guide" on the intial page says that, using the guide, you will "start a branch, write comments, and open a pull request". This is wrong. The "Hello World guide begins by asking you to create a repository.

But I already created a repository on the first page. Why? Because the description of the "Hello World guide" did not mention that it was going to ask me to create a repository. and I could see clearly that the first step on the first page was creating a repository. What does it mean to now have two repositories? No clue.

Under "creating a branch", the guide says "By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch." Yet it gives no instruction for entering any information into this definitive branch. Reading further, the guide implies that you cannot directly enter information into the "definitive branch" - you must instead create a branch off the definitive branch (for some reason, this second branch is called "feature") and "feature" will then sometime in the future be merged into the definitive branch. The guide also suggests that if other people work on your definitive branch while you are working in the "feature" branch, you can "pull in those updates". How do you know that someone else is working on your definitive branch when you're off working on your "feature branch"? No hint.

At this point, the actually name choices "repository" "definitive branch" "feature branch" just seem so weak and non-descriptive that I really question spending any further time contemplating these issues.

Also, in an editor, pressing the "end" key should take the cursor to the end of the current line, not the end of the current paragraph.
